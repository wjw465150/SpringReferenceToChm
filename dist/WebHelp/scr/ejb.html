    <p>
      As a lightweight container, Spring is often considered an EJB
      replacement. We do believe that for many if not most applications and use
      cases, Spring as a container, combined with its rich supporting
      functionality in the area of transactions, ORM and JDBC access, is a better
      choice than implementing equivalent functionality via an EJB container and
      EJBs.
      </p>
    <p>
      However, it is important to note that using Spring does not prevent
      you from using EJBs. In fact, Spring makes it much easier to access EJBs and
      implement EJBs and functionality within them. Additionally, using Spring to
      access services provided by EJBs allows the implementation of those services
      to later transparently be switched between local EJB, remote EJB, or POJO
      (plain old Java object) variants, without the client code having to
      be changed.
      </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we look at how Spring can help you access and
      implement EJBs. Spring provides particular value when accessing stateless
      session beans (SLSBs), so we'll begin by discussing this.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" title="22.2&nbsp;Accessing EJBs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ejb-access"></a>22.2&nbsp;Accessing EJBs</h2></div></div></div>
        

        <div class="section" title="22.2.1&nbsp;Concepts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ejb-access-concepts"></a>22.2.1&nbsp;Concepts</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>
                To invoke a method on a local or remote stateless session bean,
                client code must normally perform a JNDI lookup to obtain the (local or
                remote) EJB Home object, then use a 'create' method call on that object
                to obtain the actual (local or remote) EJB object. One or more methods
                are then invoked on the EJB.
      </p>
            <p>
                To avoid repeated low-level code, many EJB applications use the
                Service Locator and Business Delegate patterns. These are better than
                spraying JNDI lookups throughout client code, but their usual
                implementations have significant disadvantages. For example:
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
                    <p>
                        Typically code using EJBs depends on Service Locator or
                        Business Delegate singletons, making it hard to test.
                    </p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>
                        In the case of the Service Locator pattern used without a
                        Business Delegate, application code still ends up having to invoke
                        the create() method on an EJB home, and deal with the resulting
                        exceptions. Thus it remains tied to the EJB API and the complexity
                        of the EJB programming model.
                    </p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>
                        Implementing the Business Delegate pattern typically results
                        in significant code duplication, where we have to write numerous
                        methods that simply call the same method on the EJB.
                    </p>
                </li></ul></div>
            <p>
                The Spring approach is to allow the creation and use of proxy objects,
                normally configured inside a Spring container, which act as codeless
                business delegates. You do not need	to write another Service Locator, another
                JNDI lookup, or duplicate methods in a hand-coded Business Delegate unless
                you are actually adding real value in such code.
            </p>

        <div class="section" title="22.2.2&nbsp;Accessing local SLSBs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ejb-access-local"></a>22.2.2&nbsp;Accessing local SLSBs</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>
                Assume that we have a web controller that needs to use a local
                EJB. We&#8217;ll follow best practice and use the EJB Business Methods
                Interface pattern, so that the EJB&#8217;s local interface extends a non
                EJB-specific business methods interface. Let&#8217;s call this business
                methods interface <code class="classname">MyComponent</code>.
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-keyword">public</span> <span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> MyComponent {
    ...
}</pre>
            <p>
                One of the main reasons to use the Business Methods Interface pattern
                is to ensure that synchronization between method signatures in local
                interface and bean implementation class is automatic. Another reason is
                that it later makes it much easier for us to switch to a POJO (plain old
                Java object) implementation of the service if it makes sense to do so.
                Of course we&#8217;ll also need to implement the local home interface and
                provide an implementation class that implements <code class="classname">SessionBean</code>
                and the <code class="classname">MyComponent</code> business methods interface. Now the
                only Java coding we&#8217;ll  need to do to hook up our web tier controller to the
                EJB implementation is to expose a setter method of type <code class="classname">MyComponent</code>
                on the controller. This will save the reference as an instance variable in the
                controller:
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-keyword">private</span> MyComponent myComponent;

<span class="hl-keyword">public</span> <span class="hl-keyword">void</span> setMyComponent(MyComponent myComponent) {
    <span class="hl-keyword">this</span>.myComponent = myComponent;
}</pre>
            <p>
                We can subsequently use this instance variable in any business
                method in the controller. Now assuming we are obtaining our controller
                object out of a Spring container, we can (in the same context) configure a
                <code class="classname">LocalStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean</code> instance, which
                will be the EJB proxy object. The configuration of the proxy, and setting of
                the <code class="literal">myComponent</code> property of the controller is done
                with a configuration entry such as:
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-tag">&lt;bean</span> <span class="hl-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hl-value">"myComponent"</span>
      <span class="hl-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hl-value">"org.springframework.ejb.access.LocalStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean"</span><span class="hl-tag">&gt;</span>

<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/bean&gt;</span>

<span class="hl-tag">&lt;bean</span> <span class="hl-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hl-value">"myController"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hl-value">"com.mycom.myController"</span><span class="hl-tag">&gt;</span>
  <span class="hl-tag">&lt;property</span> <span class="hl-attribute">name</span>=<span class="hl-value">"myComponent"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">ref</span>=<span class="hl-value">"myComponent"</span><span class="hl-tag">/&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/bean&gt;</span></pre>
            <p>
                There&#8217;s a lot of work happening behind the scenes, courtesy of
                the Spring AOP framework, although you aren&#8217;t forced to work with AOP
                concepts to enjoy the results. The <code class="literal">myComponent</code> bean
                definition creates a proxy for the EJB, which implements the business
                method interface. The EJB local home is cached on startup, so there&#8217;s
                only a single JNDI lookup. Each time the EJB is invoked, the proxy
                invokes the <code class="literal">classname</code> method on the local EJB and
                invokes the	corresponding business method on the EJB.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code class="literal">myController</code> bean definition sets the
                <code class="literal">myComponent</code> property of the controller class to the
                EJB proxy.
            </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively (and preferably in case of many such proxy definitions),
        consider using the <code class="literal">&lt;jee:local-slsb&gt;</code>
        configuration element in Spring's "jee" namespace:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-tag">&lt;jee:local-slsb</span> <span class="hl-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hl-value">"myComponent"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">jndi-name</span>=<span class="hl-value">"ejb/myBean"</span>
      <span class="hl-attribute">business-interface</span>=<span class="hl-value">"com.mycom.MyComponent"</span><span class="hl-tag">/&gt;</span>

<span class="hl-tag">&lt;bean</span> <span class="hl-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hl-value">"myController"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hl-value">"com.mycom.myController"</span><span class="hl-tag">&gt;</span>
  <span class="hl-tag">&lt;property</span> <span class="hl-attribute">name</span>=<span class="hl-value">"myComponent"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">ref</span>=<span class="hl-value">"myComponent"</span><span class="hl-tag">/&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/bean&gt;</span></pre>
            <p>
                This EJB access mechanism delivers huge simplification of
                application code: the web tier code (or other EJB client code) has no
                dependence on the use of EJB. If we want to replace this EJB reference
                with a POJO or a mock object or other test stub, we could simply change
                the <code class="literal">myComponent</code> bean definition without changing a
                line of Java code. Additionally, we haven&#8217;t had to write a single line of
                JNDI lookup or other EJB plumbing code as part of our application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benchmarks and experience in real applications indicate that the
                performance overhead of this approach (which involves reflective
                invocation of the target EJB) is minimal, and is typically undetectable
                in typical use. Remember that we don&#8217;t want to make fine-grained calls
                to EJBs anyway, as there&#8217;s a cost associated with the EJB infrastructure
                in the application server.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is one caveat with regards to the JNDI lookup. In a bean
                container, this class is normally best used as a singleton (there simply
                is no reason to make it a prototype). However, if that bean container
                pre-instantiates singletons (as do the various XML
                <code class="classname">ApplicationContext</code> variants)
                you may have a problem if the bean container is loaded before the EJB
                container loads the target EJB. That is because the JNDI lookup will be
                performed in the <code class="literal">init()</code> method of this class and then
                cached, but the EJB will not have been bound at the target location yet.
                The solution is to not pre-instantiate this factory object, but allow it
                to be created on first use. In the XML containers, this is controlled via
                the <code class="literal">lazy-init</code> attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although this will not be of interest to the majority of Spring
                users, those doing programmatic AOP work with EJBs may want to look at
                <code class="classname">LocalSlsbInvokerInterceptor</code>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" title="22.2.3&nbsp;Accessing remote SLSBs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ejb-access-remote"></a>22.2.3&nbsp;Accessing remote SLSBs</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>
                Accessing remote EJBs is essentially identical to accessing local
                EJBs, except that the
                <code class="classname">SimpleRemoteStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean</code> or
        <code class="literal">&lt;jee:remote-slsb&gt;</code> configuration element is used.
                Of course, with or without Spring, remote invocation semantics apply; a
                call to a method on an object in another VM in another computer does
                sometimes have to be treated differently in terms of usage scenarios and
                failure handling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spring's EJB client support adds one more advantage over the
                non-Spring approach. Normally it is problematic for EJB client code to
                be easily switched back and forth between calling EJBs locally or
                remotely. This is because the remote interface methods must declare that
                they throw <code class="classname">RemoteException</code>, and client code must deal
                with this, while the local interface methods don't. Client code
                written for local EJBs which needs to be moved to remote EJBs
                typically has to be modified to add handling for the remote exceptions,
                and client code written for remote EJBs which needs to be moved to local
                EJBs, can either stay the same but do a lot of unnecessary handling of
                remote exceptions, or needs to be modified to remove that code. With the
                Spring remote EJB proxy, you can instead not declare any thrown
                <code class="classname">RemoteException</code> in your Business Method Interface and
                implementing EJB code, have a remote interface which is identical except
                that it does throw <code class="classname">RemoteException</code>, and rely on the
                proxy to dynamically treat the two interfaces as if they were the same.
                That is, client code does not have to deal with the checked
                <code class="classname">RemoteException</code> class. Any actual
                <code class="classname">RemoteException</code> that is thrown during the EJB
                invocation will be re-thrown as the non-checked
                <code class="classname">RemoteAccessException</code> class, which is a subclass of
                <code class="classname">RuntimeException</code>. The target service can then be
                switched at will between a local EJB or remote EJB (or even plain Java
                object) implementation, without the client code knowing or caring. Of
                course, this is optional; there is nothing stopping you from declaring
                <code class="classname">RemoteExceptions</code> in your business interface.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="section" title="22.2.4&nbsp;Accessing EJB 2.x SLSBs versus EJB 3 SLSBs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ejb-access-ejb2-ejb3"></a>22.2.4&nbsp;Accessing EJB 2.x SLSBs versus EJB 3 SLSBs</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
        Accessing EJB 2.x Session Beans and EJB 3 Session Beans via Spring
        is largely transparent. Spring's EJB accessors, including the
        <code class="literal">&lt;jee:local-slsb&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;jee:remote-slsb&gt;</code>
        facilities, transparently adapt to the actual component at runtime.
        They handle a home interface if found (EJB 2.x style), or perform straight
        component invocations if no home interface is available (EJB 3 style).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: For EJB 3 Session Beans, you could effectively use a
        <code class="classname">JndiObjectFactoryBean</code> / <code class="literal">&lt;jee:jndi-lookup&gt;</code>
        as well, since fully usable component references are exposed for plain
        JNDI lookups there. Defining explicit <code class="literal">&lt;jee:local-slsb&gt;</code>
        / <code class="literal">&lt;jee:remote-slsb&gt;</code> lookups simply provides
        consistent and more explicit EJB access configuration.

        Spring provides convenience classes to help you implement EJBs.
        These are designed to encourage the good practice of putting business
        logic behind EJBs in POJOs, leaving EJBs responsible for transaction
        demarcation and (optionally) remoting.
      </p>
      <p>
        To implement a Stateless or Stateful session bean, or a Message Driven
        bean, you need only derive your implementation class from
        <code class="classname">AbstractStatelessSessionBean</code>,
        <code class="classname">AbstractStatefulSessionBean</code>, and
        <code class="classname">AbstractMessageDrivenBean</code>/<code class="classname">AbstractJmsMessageDrivenBean</code>,
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider an example Stateless Session bean which actually delegates
        the implementation to a plain java service object. We have the business
        interface:

      <p>
        The Spring EJB support base classes will by default create and load
        a Spring IoC container as part of their lifecycle, which is then available
        to the EJB (for example, as used in the code above to obtain the POJO
        service object). The loading is	done via a strategy object which is a subclass of
        <code class="classname">BeanFactoryLocator</code>. The actual implementation of
        <code class="classname">BeanFactoryLocator</code> used by default is
        <code class="classname">ContextJndiBeanFactoryLocator</code>, which creates the
        ApplicationContext from a resource locations specified as a JNDI
        environment variable (in the case of the EJB classes, at
        <code class="literal">java:comp/env/ejb/BeanFactoryPath</code>). If there is a need
        to change the BeanFactory/ApplicationContext loading strategy, the default
        <code class="classname">BeanFactoryLocator</code> implementation used may be overridden
        by calling the <code class="literal">setBeanFactoryLocator()</code> method, either
        in <code class="literal">setSessionContext()</code>, or in the actual constructor of
        the EJB. Please see the Javadocs for more details.
      </p>
      <p>
        As described in the Javadocs, Stateful Session beans expecting to be
        passivated and reactivated as part of their lifecycle, and which use a
        non-serializable container instance (which is the normal case) will have
        to manually call <code class="literal">unloadBeanFactory()</code> and
        <code class="literal">loadBeanFactory()</code> from <code class="literal">ejbPassivate()</code>
        and <code class="literal">ejbActivate()</code>, respectively, to unload and reload the
        BeanFactory on passivation and activation, since it can not be saved by
        the EJB container.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default behavior of the
        <code class="classname">ContextJndiBeanFactoryLocator</code> class is to load an
        <code class="classname">ApplicationContext</code> for use by an EJB, and is
        adequate for some situations. However, it is problematic when the
        <code class="classname">ApplicationContext</code> is loading a number of beans,
        or the initialization of those beans is time consuming or memory
        intensive (such as a Hibernate <code class="classname">SessionFactory</code>
        initialization, for example), since every EJB will have their own copy.
        In this case, the user may want to override the default
        <code class="classname">ContextJndiBeanFactoryLocator</code> usage and use
        another <code class="classname">BeanFactoryLocator</code> variant, such as the
        <code class="classname">ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator</code> which can load
        and use a shared container to be used by multiple EJBs or other clients.
        Doing this is relatively simple, by adding code similar to this to the
        EJB:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">   <b class="hl-tag" style="color: blue">/**
    * Override default BeanFactoryLocator implementation
    * @see javax.ejb.SessionBean#setSessionContext(javax.ejb.SessionContext)
    */</b>
   <span class="hl-keyword">public</span> <span class="hl-keyword">void</span> setSessionContext(SessionContext sessionContext) {
       <span class="hl-keyword">super</span>.setSessionContext(sessionContext);
       setBeanFactoryLocator(ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator.getInstance());
       setBeanFactoryLocatorKey(ServicesConstants.PRIMARY_CONTEXT_ID);
   }</pre>
      <p>
        You would then need to create a bean definition file named <code class="literal">beanRefContext.xml</code>.
        This file defines all bean factories (usually in the form of application contexts) that may be used
        in the EJB. In many cases, this file will only contain a single bean definition such as this (where
        <code class="literal">businessApplicationContext.xml</code> contains the bean	definitions for all business
        service POJOs):
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-tag">&lt;beans&gt;</span>
    <span class="hl-tag">&lt;bean</span> <span class="hl-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hl-value">"businessBeanFactory"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hl-value">"org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext"</span><span class="hl-tag">&gt;</span>
        <span class="hl-tag">&lt;constructor-arg</span> <span class="hl-attribute">value</span>=<span class="hl-value">"businessApplicationContext.xml"</span><span class="hl-tag"> /&gt;</span>
    <span class="hl-tag">&lt;/bean&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/beans&gt;</span></pre>
      <p>
        In the above example, the <code class="literal">ServicesConstants.PRIMARY_CONTEXT_ID</code> constant
        would be defined as follows:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-keyword">public</span> <span class="hl-keyword">static</span> <span class="hl-keyword">final</span> String ServicesConstants.PRIMARY_CONTEXT_ID = <span class="hl-string">"businessBeanFactory"</span>;</pre>
        <p>
        Please see the respective Javadocs for the <code class="classname">BeanFactoryLocator</code> and
        <code class="classname">ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator</code> classes for more information on
        their usage.

      <p>
        For EJB 3 Session Beans and Message-Driven Beans, Spring provides a convenient
        interceptor that resolves Spring 2.5's <code class="literal">@Autowired</code> annotation
        in the EJB component class:
        <code class="classname">org.springframework.ejb.interceptor.SpringBeanAutowiringInterceptor</code>.
        This interceptor can be applied through an <code class="code">@Interceptors</code> annotation
        in the EJB component class, or through an <code class="literal">interceptor-binding</code>
        XML element in the EJB deployment descriptor.
      </p>

    }
    ...
}</pre>
      <p>
        <code class="classname">SpringBeanAutowiringInterceptor</code> by default obtains target
        beans from a <code class="classname">ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator</code>, with the
        context defined in a bean definition file named <code class="literal">beanRefContext.xml</code>.
        By default, a single context definition is expected, which is obtained by type rather
        than by name. However, if you need to choose between multiple context definitions,
        a specific locator key is required. The locator key (i.e. the name of the context
        definition in <code class="literal">beanRefContext.xml</code>) can be explicitly specified
        either through overriding the <code class="literal">getBeanFactoryLocatorKey</code> method
        in a custom <code class="classname">SpringBeanAutowiringInterceptor</code> subclass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, consider overriding <code class="classname">SpringBeanAutowiringInterceptor</code>'s
        <code class="literal">getBeanFactory</code> method, e.g. obtaining a shared
        <code class="interfacename">ApplicationContext</code> from a custom holder class.
